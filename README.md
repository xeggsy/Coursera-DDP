This repository will serve as my prime database for the Coursera course: Developing Data Products. The content is still under development and therefore might not always be up to date. Nevertheless, feel free to fork or pull anything needed from this repository to help further your knowledge related to the course. However, please do refrain from asking me to post extra content any time soon, because I am currently not at liberty to perform such acts.
